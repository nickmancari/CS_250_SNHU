- How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

	Typically, a Product Owner or some other representative who is customer-facing will interface with the customer and gather insights that they can bring back to the development team. These insights can be compiled into small segments that are called "user stories", and the development team can take these stories and construct feature changes based on the stories. This process is helpful in knowing what to add to a product in order to imporve it.

- How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

	Keeping things small and "broken up" allowes the work to be much more manageable. This is something I hope to apply to tasks that I will work on in the future with regard to my development work.

- What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

	An active and engaged team member is a perfect example of how a team member should behave in a team. When a team member communicates effectively and within a timely manner, it makes the process easier with less headaches.
